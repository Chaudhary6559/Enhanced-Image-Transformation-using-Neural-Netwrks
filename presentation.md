# Enhanced Image Transformation Using Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
- Integration of classical DIP with modern ANN techniques
- Multiple transformation styles: cartoon, Ghibli, sketch
- Comprehensive evaluation and comparison

## Limitations of Classical DIP
- Edge detection limitations (noise sensitivity, lack of semantic understanding)
- Color quantization limitations (simplistic reduction, lack of style-specific coloring)
- Bilateral filtering limitations (computational intensity, limited texture handling)
- Overall artistic style limitations (generic look, no learning capability)

## ANN-Based Enhancements
- CNN-based cartoonization with U-Net architecture
- GAN-based Ghibli-style transformation
- RNN-LSTM-based sketch generation
- Integration with classical techniques

## Neural Network Components
- Activation functions: ReLU, LeakyReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid
- Weight initializers: He, Xavier/Glorot, LeCun
- Optimizers: SGD, Adam, RMSprop

## Results
- Quantitative evaluation: MSE, PSNR, SSIM
- Processing time comparison
- User preference study
- Ablation study

## Conclusion
- Neural approaches outperform classical DIP
- GAN-based models achieve highest quality
- Hybrid approaches leverage strengths of both paradigms
- Future work: video processing, additional styles, mobile deployment
